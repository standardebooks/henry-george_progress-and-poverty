						<span>Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Ere the sorrow comes with years?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And <em>that</em> cannot stop their tears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The young lambs are bleating in the meadows;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The young birds are chirping in the nest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The young fawns are playing with the shadows;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The young flowers are blowing toward the west⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But the young, young children, O, my brothers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">They are weeping bitterly!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They are weeping in the playtime of the others,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">In the country of the free.</span>
