				<p>Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree.</p>
				<p>And they shall build houses and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat.</p>
